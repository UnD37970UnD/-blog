I kind of liked the idea of having my own server just to tinker around. And finally 2-3 months ago i bough a second hand pc, with an i5 6500 and 8gb ram. From then i slowly added 1TB HDD, 2TB HDD and a 512GB SSD. As a beginner it's hard to know from start what are the next steps, what OS to install and what services would be good to have plus... how would i install them (inside docker, in a VM, or run an LXC).
