All I hear when searching for sideproject ideas.. is to find a problem and resolve that. But how can I find THE problem?(not too big.. not to unimportant).

## idea 1 - openOrders

One idea struck me when I was reading a post made by a restaurant owner. He was asking if it’s okay to contact a local firm for his restaurant website, and he also wanted to take orders from the website, or to search on Fiverr for someone to do it. Many comments were about why he is not using a delivery platform like Glovo or Bolt Food. He replied that the cut was too big to even have a 0% ROI (the platforms take a 30% cut of the order price). So, I think that an open-source, self-hosted platform is a good idea. As for profit, I can just ask for hosting fees and a fixed amount of money based on the number of orders in a month. I will still need to make that profitable for the customer, in this case, the restaurant owner.

## idea 2 - TBD

*pref.*  This is more a solution, and not a problem; but i can still see the problem for home owners with multiple "assets"

A few days ago, I was browsing Reddit and came across a mention of a platform for apartment block administration. This platform allows owners to view announcements and pay their “maintenance” bills. In Romania, we pay a “maintenance fee” which includes expenses like garbage collection, water, commonly used electricity for lights and elevators, salaries for the administrator and the cleaning staff, among others. The platform also provides administrative features, allowing administrators to manage each apartment, calculate fees, and even has an automatic system to help with accounting and invoice creation.
However, this platform may not be suitable for me, as I would need more information on how all the bills are calculated, along with other administrative details about the finances in this department of block administration.
