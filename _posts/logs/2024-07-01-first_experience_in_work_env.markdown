## My Little Experience as a Web Dev (WordPress Designer... Don't Laugh)

### And what I've learned working on a startup web agency

My journey as a web developer, or more accurately, a WordPress designer, has raised a few questions. Here are some thoughts based on my experiences working with my boss and other clients:

1. Why Do We Need to Be So Pushy? - Why do we always seem to be begging for work? It feels like the main goal is to secure jobs just for the sake of making money. Is there a better way to approach this? Shouldn't our focus be on providing value and building relationships rather than just closing deals?
2. Why Do We Need to Be Excited About Everything? - Why is there an expectation to be constantly enthusiastic and dive headfirst into every task? It's exhausting to maintain that level of energy all the time. Is genuine passion being replaced by forced excitement, and is this sustainable in the long run?
3. Is a Good Team Really Possible? - A good team is supposed to be built on mutual respect and care for one another. But what happens when someone doesn't do their job? Do we address the issue directly with the person involved, or do we talk behind their back? Should we go to our boss, and what if the boss is friends with the person in question? Are we truly a good team if we focus solely on performance, or should we be empathetic and try to understand the reasons behind someone's lack of performance?
4. The "WTF?!" Moments - Not knowing all types of people has led to some "WTF?!" moments for me. For instance, I've been asked questions that weren't related to work but were within my field of expertise. These questions seemed to be thrown out just for the sake of conversation, not because they needed real answers. How do we navigate these situations effectively? Or is it necessary to answer them?
